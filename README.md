# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Hereâ€™s a template for your job listing web app README. You can modify specific details to fit your project:

# Job Listing Web App

This project is a simple **Job Listing Web Application** built using React and JSON Server. The app allows users to view fetched from a mock backend.

## Features

- View a list of available job listings
- add delete jobs
- Responsive design, mobile-friendly
- Built-in mock backend using JSON Server

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS (or any CSS framework you're using)
- **Backend:** JSON Server (mock API)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Routing:** React Router for page navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-listing-app.git
   cd job-listing-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the JSON Server:**

   JSON Server will act as the mock backend API for job listings.

   ```bash
   npx json-server --watch data/jobs.json --port 8000
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the React components and pages
  - `components/`: Reusable components (e.g., JobCard, Navbar)
  - `pages/`: Pages like Home, JobDetails
  - `services/`: API calls to fetch data from the JSON server
- `data/jobs.json`: Mock job listings stored as JSON

## Usage

1. **Viewing Jobs:**
   On the homepage, you can browse the available job listings. Each job card shows the title, company name, location, and type (e.g., full-time, part-time).

2. **Searching and Filtering:**
   Use the search bar to search for jobs by title or company. Use filters to narrow down the job listings.

3. **Job Details:**
   Click on a job to view more detailed information about the position, including the description and application process.

## JSON Server Data

The job data is stored in a `jobs.json` file under the `data/` folder. Here's a sample structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Frontend Developer",
    "company": "TechCorp",
    "location": "Remote",
    "type": "Full-time",
    "description": "A great opportunity for a Frontend Developer...",
    "requirements": "2+ years of experience in React..."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Backend Developer",
    "company": "DevSolutions",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "type": "Part-time",
    "description": "Looking for an experienced Backend Developer...",
    "requirements": "Experience with Node.js and Express..."
  }
]
```

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and authorization
- Create an admin panel to add, edit, or delete job listings
- Add sorting functionality for job listings (e.g., by date or location)
